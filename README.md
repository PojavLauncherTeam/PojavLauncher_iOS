## Introduction
PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk). This launcher can launch most of available Minecraft versions (from 1.6.1 to 21w08b (1.17) snapshot, including Combat Test versions). 1.17 support is available with our current workaround described [here](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/updates/117). Modding via Forge (1.16.x only) and Fabric are also supported. Older versions of Forge and Fabric can be used with OpenJDK 8. This repository contains source code for iOS/iPadOS platform. For Android platform, check out [PojavLauncher repository](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher).

This launcher is available on the Procursus repo, thanks to [@Diatrus](https://twitter.com/Diatrus), and Doregon's Repository, thanks to [@Doregon](https://twitter.com/AdamTunnic)

## Getting started with PojavLauncher

The [PojavLauncher Website](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io) has extensive documentation on how to install, set up, and play! For those who wish to install quickly, here's the basics (on iOS 12 or later):

### Procursus-bootstraps
If you have Chimera, Taurine, Odyssey, or another jailbreak that comes with **libhooker**, this one's for you.

1. Search for `pojavlauncher` with your favorite package manager.
2. Install `PojavLauncher iOS`.

### Bingner/Elucubratus bootstraps
If you have unc0ver, checkra1n, or another jailbreak that comes with **Cydia Substrate** or **Substitute**, this one's for you. You can also use this if you have a libhooker jailbreak.

1. Add `https://doregon.github.io/cydia` to your sources list.
2. Search for `pojavlauncher` with your favorite package manager.
3. Install the package you wish to have, according to your preference:
   * `pojavlauncher` is the stable build. This one gets updated with new releases or tags on this repository, or when Procursus updated their copy.
   * `pojavlauncher-dev` is the latest commit on the `main` branch of this repository. It may have application breaking bugs, but also has more features.
   * `pojavlauncher-zink` is the latest commit on the `backend_zink` branch of this repository. This is the preprepreprealpha of the Zink graphics libraries that are being ported to allow 1.17 to work. This is not recommended, but fun to test.

## Known issues
* Minecraft 1.12.2 and below are very buggy: you can't type text, random crashes, etc...
* When using certain versions, the camera may jump to a random position when you start to touch the screen.
* Some Forge versions may fail with `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException`.
* The game will be prone to JetsamEvents.

## Work in progress
* Custom controls
* OpenJDK 8 iOS port
