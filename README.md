## Introduction
PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk).
This launcher can launch most of available Minecraft versions (up to latest 1.19, including Combat Test versions).
1.17+ support is available as of v2.0, or with the workarounds described on our [website](https://pojav.ml).
Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.
Older versions of Forge and Fabric can be used with OpenJDK 8.
This repository contains source code for iOS/iPadOS platform.
For Android platform, check out [PojavLauncher repository](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher).

This launcher is available on the Procursus repo, thanks to [@Diatrus](https://twitter.com/Diatrus), and Doregon's Repository, thanks to [@crystall1ndev](https://twitter.com/crystall1nedev)

## Getting started with PojavLauncher

The [PojavLauncher Website](https://pojav.ml) has extensive documentation on how to install, set up, and play! For those who wish to install quickly, here's the basics (on iOS 12 or later):

### Without jailbreak (sideload as IPA)
Note: This is experimental, although game works smoothly, you should not set Render distance too much.

1. Install [AltStore](https://altstore.io)
2. Download an IPA build of PojavLauncher in the Actions tab.
3. Open the downloaded IPA in AltStore to install.
4. Launch PojavLauncher with JIT enabled.

### Procursus-bootstraps
*Note: This is currently unavailable. Will be fixed soon! For the meantime, you can follow the same way as [below](#bingnerelucubratus-bootstraps)*.
If you have Chimera, Taurine, Odyssey, or another jailbreak that comes with **libhooker**, this one's for you.

1. Search for `pojavlauncher` with your favorite package manager.
2. Install `PojavLauncher iOS`.

### Bingner/Elucubratus bootstraps
If you have unc0ver, checkra1n, or another jailbreak that comes with **Cydia Substrate** or **Substitute**, this one's for you. You can also use this if you have a libhooker jailbreak.

1. Add `https://repository.crystall1ne.software` to your sources list.
2. Search for `pojavlauncher` with your favorite package manager.
3. Install the package you wish to have, according to your preference:
   * `pojavlauncher.release` is the stable build. This one gets updated with new releases or tags on this repository, or when Procursus updated their copy.
   * `pojavlauncher.development` is the latest commit on the `main` branch of this repository. It may have application breaking bugs, but also has more features.
   * The rootless variants serve the same purpose, but only work with Procursus jailbreaks and iOS 15 (see our website for more information).

## Known issues
* Some Forge versions may fail with `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException`.
* The game will be prone to JetsamEvents.
